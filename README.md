Aspiring Cloud-Native Software Engineer | Self-taught using mobile tools (Termux, Git, SoloLearn) | Building solutions for small businesses & mastering AI.

## About Me

I’m Kirsten, a 17-year-old tech enthusiast from Kenya. With no access to a laptop, I’ve dedicated my time to learning software engineering using only a mobile device. My daily focus is Python, AI integration, and cloud-native development.

My goal: Build powerful, scalable tools—and retire my parent through tech.
